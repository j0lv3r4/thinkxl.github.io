I don&rsquo;t want to rest credit to the people that solve problems using less resources (resources optimization), or people that are smart enough to figure things out without deeply knowledge on the subject.

This is a rant post about psueo-developers selling mediocre products and poor coded websites. Not because they should not get business, of course there are people that would be more than happy to save some dollars and get shitty websites.

I can hand-code an entire website with a text editor using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I think this give me some credibility on this writing.

I always try to follow the web standards and good practices preached by the people building that weird and innovative thing called the Internet. It become some kind of a *religion* to me, meaning that, I always try do things the &ldquo;right way&rdquo;.

The *right way* could mean different things for different designers/developers; over complicated solutions or even unnecessary extra work to mention a few.

I understand that, but, when I see things like:

- Three years old websites built on tables. 
- Websites using a Perl script to send emails, that its latest release was 13 years ago.
- User interface based entirely on images, including text or menu elements.
- Having a jQuery plugin with ~200 lines of code to make a dropdown menu.
- Having to modify all the <abbr>HTML</abbr> files to add a link on the footer.

I freak out.

Mostly because I have to spend several hours fixing their mess and lose money on the same move. 

Clients don&rsquo;t know (and don&rsquo;t care) how good is the code behind the website they receive and pay for, they see it up and running and they expect everything is OK.

I understand that people like to be on the confort zone, doing the same things, every day, just to receive their pay check. But when you do this on technology areas related to the Internet, then it become a self-killing process.

As professionals offering &ldquo;quality&rdquo; products we should spend more time adding knowledge assets to our skills.

In my honest opinion the *right way* is making your final product an **accessible, semantically structured site designed and built with web standards**.
