<p class="message">Most of these projects are incomplete, so stay tunned to see if I finish them someday.</p>

## Apps

**[Frontends](http://www.frontends.org)**: Basically a Hacker news clone for Front-end developers.

**[Rocketbin](http://rocketb.in/)**: An Open Source Pastebin clone built with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org).

**[PWG](http://thinkxl.github.io/pwg/)**: Small password generator.

## Libraries

**[Hyx.scss](http://thinkxl.github.io/hyx.less/)**: Less mixin that creates small, simple and useful fluid gird systems, *recently ported to [Sass](https://github.com/thinkxl/hyx.scss) too*.

**[Type.scss](https://github.com/thinkxl/type)**: Sass library for setting good type styling (need to rename it, though).
